# ATM UI Assignment
<img src= "Screenshot.png" />

## Description of Project
In this exercise, an ATM user interface needed to be created to mimic a true ATM machine. The functionality of the code allows you to deposit a specified amount with the "Deposit" option or allows you to withdraw a specified amount using the "Cash Back" option. Additionally, code was written to make sure the user cannot withdraw over the amount that is within their account. The transaction will not process. How to Run: In order to run this file, download all the files to a singular location. Open a tab in the browser window and drag the index.html file. You can begin to interact with the code when you make a selection of depositing money. Notice that the amount will update when you input a variety of numbers. Roadmap: I hope to revisit this project to adjust and make the UI styles better looking. Aligning all the text and input boxes so that they are in one area and then also fixing the background colors.
